# Views
Let's go frontend with **views**! Simply put, they are pages pertaining to a module. A module can have many views that can display different layouts or how views are restricted to certain users.

In Odoo, these are defined in XML files rather than in HTML or any derivative of.

## The `__init__.py` file (in root)
Unlike the previous section, the `views` folder only consists of XML files without any manifests files. They are instead managed in the root `__manifest__.py` file of your module.

For a scaffolded model, a snippet of this manifest file is shown below:
````python
# always loaded
'data': [
    # 'security/ir.model.access.csv',
    'views/views.xml',
    'views/templates.xml',
],
````
In the instance you'll implement more views (or XML files) within the `views` folder of your module, be sure to add these in your root `__manifest__.py` file of your module.

Sidenote, you can also notice the commented CSV file, which will be discussed in the next section.

From this point forward, we will be referring to the `views` folder of your module.

## The `views.xml` file
Similar to the boilerplate `models.py` file that we discussed in the previous section, we'll also be working with this provided boilerplate file for our views. Of course, you can modularize your views and menu items in separate distinct XML files, but you should double-check the root `__manifest__.py` file to ensure that they are included!

Anyways, these views will always be defined inside an `<odoo>` tag along with closing it with an `</odoo>` tag at the end of the XML file.

## Creating Views
A view comprises of this general syntax:
````xml
<record model=<model_name> id=<view_id>>
    <field name=<field_name> type=<type>
</record>
````

In the `<record>` tag, both the `model` and `id` tags are required. The `id` tag is usually the name of a particular view 

### The `model` attribute
The following is a list that can be attributed in this attribute:

* `ir.ui.view` - This is the model for views. It is used to define the view itself and is the most commonly used model.

* `ir.action.act_window` - This is the model for window actions (opening a model in a certain view)

* `ir.acti\ns.server` - This is the model for server-side actions (executing a Python function)

* `ir.actions.client` - This is the model for client-side actions (executing a JavaScript function)

* `ir.ui.menu` - Model for menu items

* `ir.model.access` - This is the model for access rights (like read/write/create/delete rules)

The first two are the most commonly used for creating views.

### (Finally) Creating a View
From our `teacher` model example, we want to create a list view. This view will be then having the model `ir.ui.view` and the `id` as `teacher_tree_view`. The field names are respective of the attributes we defined in the previous section.

````xml
<record id="teacher_tree_view" model="ir.ui.view">
    <field name="name">teacher.teacher.list</field>
    <field name="model">teacher.teacher</field>
    <field name="arch" type="xml">
        <tree string="Teacher List">
            <field name="employee_ID"/>
            <field name="lname"/>
            <field name="fname"/>
            <field name="mname"/>
            <field name="title"/>
            <field name="college"/>
            <field name="department"/>
        </tree>
    </field>
</record>
````

Afterwards, we want to create a form view for this model as well where new data can be inputted,

````xml
<record id="teacher_form_view" model="ir.ui.view">
    <field name="name">teacher.teacher.form</field>
    <field name="model">teacher.teacher</field>
    <field name="arch" type="xml">
        <form string="Teacher Form">
            <sheet>
                <group>
                    <group>
                        <field name="fname"/>
                        <field name="mname"/>
                        <field name="lname"/>
                        <field name="gender"/>
                    </group>
                    <group>
                        <field name="employee_ID"/>
                        <field name="title"/>
                        <field name="college"/>
                        <field name="department"/>
                    </group>
                </group>
            </sheet>
        </form>
    </field>
</record>
````

### Creating Action Opening Views on Models
To open the views we created, we need to create an action that will open the list view. This is done with the `ir.actions.act_window` model.

````xml
<record id="action_teacher_list" model="ir.actions.act_window">
    <field name="name">Teacher</field>
    <field name="res_model">teacher.teacher</field>
    <field name="type">ir.actions.act_window</field>
    <field name="view_mode">tree,form</field>
</record>
````

## Creating Menu Items
### The Root Menu Item
The root menu item is what appears in the Home Menu found in the top-left corner of our Odoo instance. This is done with the use of a `<menuitem />` tag with a required `id`, `name` and `sequence` attribute.

This menu item is uniquely identified with its `id` attribute appended with a `_root` suffix.

For instance in our `teacher` model that we scaffolded,
````xml
<menuitem id="teacher_menu_root"
    name="Teacher"
    sequence="10"/>
````

You can also uncomment the following line in the scaffolded model, lines 43-46:
````xml
    <!-- Top menu item -->
<!--
    <menuitem name="teacher" id="teacher.menu_root"/>
-->
````

> ### **`ï½‰` Note**
> In the XML file, **the view must come first before the menu item**; `<record>` before `<menuitem>`. Think of it as like defining functions in C first before calling them in `main()`.
