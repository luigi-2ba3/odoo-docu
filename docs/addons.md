# Add-ons and Modules
Add-ons can be viewed as "modules" in a particular Odoo instance. In the [Using Odoo](using.md) section, we already have accessed the dashboard or the "Apps" page, which displayed numerous items like *Sales*, *Invoicing*, and so forth. These items are also add-ons of their own.

Add-ons are not necessarily applications seen in this page by default. They could be used to aid in the Odoo instance by whatever purpose the developer wants to carry it out with.

## Displaying All Add-ons Present
While in **debug mode** in the dashboard, simply head to the search field for the apps and press `Backspace` to remove the *Apps* filter. This will display all add-ons present in the Odoo instance.

As shown, add-ons that aren't applications but come with the default Odoo instance do not show a dedicated icon but rather, a generic, outlined cube. It can also be seen that the number of items on the sidebar filtering all the add-ons by categories will increase.
