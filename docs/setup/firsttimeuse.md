For development purposes, you can supply these credentials with familiar or dummy details. For production, these should be secured however.

## Invoking Debug Mode
For more in-depth purposes, especially when creating custom add-ons or modules, summon the command bar by pressing `CTRL + K` or `CMD + K` on Mac. Type `debug` and select the first option.
